          The smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter, Europa is a
          winter lover’s dream. With an icy surface, it’s perfect for a bit of
          ice skating, curling, hockey, or simple relaxation in your snug
          wintery cabin.

          Don’t forget to pack your hiking boots. You’ll need them to tackle
          Olympus Mons, the tallest planetary mountain in our solar system. It’s
          two and a half times the size of Everest!

          See our planet as you’ve never seen it before. A perfect relaxing trip
          away to help regain perspective and come back refreshed. While you’re
          there, take in some history by visiting the Luna 2 and Apollo 11
          landing sites.

          The only moon known to have a dense atmosphere other than Earth, Titan
          is a home away from home (just a few hundred degrees colder!). As a
          bonus, you get striking views of the Rings of Saturn.
